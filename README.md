# Advent of Code 2021

This repo holds ECB's solutions for [AOC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). All solutions are under `src/main/kotlin`, with every day having its own solution file (i.e. `src/main/kotlin/01.kt` for day 1). Puzzle inputs for each day are located under `src/main/resources` (i.e. `src/main/resources/input_01.txt` for day 1).

The create a new solution, duplicate `src/main/kotlin/00.kt` replacing `00` for whichever day you are on, add your puzzle input with the filename `input_XX.txt`, and then implement your solution in methods `partOne()` and `partTwo()` from the solution file.
